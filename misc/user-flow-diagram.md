# What is a user flow diagram
User flow diagrams describe the steps a user takes from the entry point to
the end point of our app or website. 

# Stages
- **Entry point** being the point of entry a user gets when initialy getting into
  our app.
- **Steps** being the different screens a user has to navigate through before
  before reaching the end point. 
- **End point** being the goal we want a user to reach.

# User flow symbols
- **Circles** are used to represent both the __entry point__ and __end point__.
- **Rectangles** are used to represent the different steps a user takes in our
  application/web app. 
- **Daimonds** also known as __descion diamonds__ are used to represent the
  possible choices a user might make in a given step.
- **Arrows** denote the connection between the steps of the flow's direction.

# Tips for creating user flow diagrams
1. Keep colors simple
2. Have meaningful labels
3. Be consistent
4. Refine your diagram as you work on your project, perhaps create higher
   fidelity ones ?
